## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties

### What I learned

I learned the difference between using flexbox and grid. And how to use media queries for a more responsive website.


### Continued development

I want to build more using mobile first design. To build mmore responsive websites depending on the user's screen. To learn more abot flexbox and grid. 


### Useful resources

- [CSS-TRICKS](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand flexbox. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
- [Web Dev Simplified](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYq5PXgSsbE&t=24s) - This helped me learn about more about flexbox.
